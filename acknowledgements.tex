	This work would not be possible without the support of the LIGO collaboration and the University of Oregon.
	I would like to thank Ray Frey for guiding and advising me throughout my journey.
	I also thank Robert Schofield for getting me involved with environmental noise studies.
	I am thankful for the many members of the Oregon LIGO group who have provided helpful input or directly aided me in my research projects.
	My visits to LIGO Hanford Observatory always left me with valuable experiences.
	Thank you to all I've met during my time spent there, and to all who I have collaborated with in the Detector Characterization group and the Gamma-Ray Burst search group.
	I am also grateful for all the people I've met beyond LIGO during my PhD, including my peers in the UO physics department and the Eugene climbing community, who have helped keep me sane all these years.
	Most importantly, I thank my mother and father, who overcame so much in their lives to give me the opportunity to pursue a PhD in Physics, and my sister Nathalie for supporting me through everything.
