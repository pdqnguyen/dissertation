\chapter{Gravitational wave astronomy}\label{ch:gw}

The first observation of gravitational waves in 2015~\citep{gw150914} took place a century after Albert Einstein completed his general theory of relativity~\citep{Einstein_1916}.
Einstein's original publication proposed that gravitational attraction was not mediated by a force as described by Newtonian physics, but rather it was caused by the curvature of space-time due to the presence of mass.
He primarily discussed the relevance of general relativity to predicting gravitational redshift, the curvature of light rays, and the perihelion precession of the orbit of Mercury, a mystery that perplexed late nineteenth and early twentieth century astronomers.
However, the idea that gravitational forces might propagate in the form of waves similar to electromagnetic waves had existed since it was first speculated by Henri Poincar\'e a decade prior~\citep{Poincare_1905}, and Einstein would soon make the conjecture that his theory of general relativity could provide a robust mathematical framework for gravitational waves.

Initially, Einstein was not highly confident in his conjecture.
Electromagnetic waves are typically produced in the form of dipole radiation, formed by a positive and negative electric charge, whereas no ``negative mass'' exists to produce an analogous gravitational dipole.
His early efforts in making approximations to his field equations to yield wave-like solutions were mostly fruitless due to the complexity of the equations.
Nevertheless progress made by Einstein and his collaborators over the following decades would culminate in a theory for gravitational radiation propagating as transverse waves that squeeze and stretch matter perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

This chapter gives an overview of the theoretical background necessary for understanding the emission of \acp{GW} (Section~\ref{sec:gw-gr}), following discussions from \citet{Creighton_2011}, \citet{Hartle_2003}, \citet{Jaranowski_2009}, and \citet{Misner_1973}; known and expected sources of \ac{GW} radiation (Section~\ref{sec:gw-sources}); and the history and present-day design of \ac{GW} detectors (Section~\ref{sec:gw-detectors}).


\section{General Relativity}\label{sec:gw-gr}

In Newtonian mechanics, gravitational attraction is described as the manifestation of a gravitational potential $\Phi$ generated by a source of mass density $\rho$:
\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi\rho.
\end{equation}
General relativity relates the geometry of spacetime to the density and flux of energy and momentum through the Einstein field equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-einstein}
	G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor, analogous to the Newtonian potential $\Phi$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor, analogous to $\rho$.
Since the tensors are 4-by-4 and symmetric, \cref{eq:gr-einstein} represents ten separate equations, as opposed to the single Newtonian equation.
The energy-momentum tensor represents not just the mass density (which is described by the $T^{00}$ component alone) but also the momentum density ($T^{i0}$ and $T^{0j}$ terms, where $i,j = 1, 2, 3$) and the mechanical stress tensor ($T^{ij}$).

To unpack $G_{\mu\nu}$ we have to define some basic quantities of general relativity.
The geometry of spacetime is described by the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, via the relationship between the coordinate distances and the line element:
\begin{equation}
	ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}.
\end{equation}
% In a flat Minkowski spacetime, where the metric is
% \begin{equation}
% 	\eta_{\mu\nu} = \left(
% 			\begin{matrix}
% 				-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
% 			  0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
% 				0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
% 				0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
% 			\end{matrix}
% 		\right)
% \end{equation}
% the line element is that of special relativity: $ds^2 = -cdt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$.s
Analogous to Newton's laws of motion in classical mechanics, the geodesic equations dictate how free-falling particles in general relativity move through spacetime along geodesics
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-geodesic}
	\frac{d^2x^{\mu}}{ds^2} + \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^{\mu} \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{ds} \frac{dx^{\beta}}{ds} = 0
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-christoffel}
	\Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \left( \partial_{\alpha} g_{\beta\nu} + \partial_{\beta} g_{\nu\alpha} - \partial_{\nu} g_{\alpha\beta} \right)
\end{equation}
are called the Christoffel symbols.
\Crefrange{eq:gr-geodesic}{eq:gr-christoffel} can be derived by asserting that vectors remain unchanged under parallel transport from one point to another within the spacetime described by $g_{\mu\nu}$.
The Christoffel symbols thus encode the effects of curvature on otherwise straight paths; note that in rectilinear coordinates they vanish and \cref{eq:gr-geodesic} reduces to the equation for a straight line.

A useful quantity is the Riemann curvature tensor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-riemann}
	R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} = g_{\rho\lambda} \left(
		\partial_{\mu} \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\sigma}
		- \partial_{\nu} \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\sigma}
		+ \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\eta} \Gamma^{\eta}_{\nu\sigma}
		- \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\eta} \Gamma^{\eta}_{\mu\sigma}
	\right)
\end{equation}
from which we can define the Ricci tensor and its trace, the Ricci scalar:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-ricci-tensor}
	R_{\mu\nu} = g^{\rho\sigma} R_{\rho\mu\sigma\nu}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-ricci-scalar}
	R = g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
The Einstein tensor from \cref{eq:gr-einstein} can be written in terms of these quantities and the metric:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-G}
	G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Linear gravity}

We define our coordinate system such that the metric can be expressed as the flat Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ plus a small perturbation $\abs{h_{\mu\nu}} \ll 1$: $g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu}$.
This allows us to develop a linearized form of the field equations, which we can then solve to arrive at a theory of \textit{weak} gravitational radiation.
The Christoffel symbols become
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-christoffel-lin}
	\Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} \eta^{\mu\nu} \left( \partial_{\alpha} h_{\beta\nu} + \partial_{\beta} h_{\nu\alpha} - \partial_{\nu} h_{\alpha\beta} \right) + \order{h^2}.
\end{equation}
Combining these with \cref{eq:gr-riemann} gives the linearized Riemann tensor:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-riemann-lin}
	R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} = \frac{1}{2} \left(
		\partial_{\rho} \partial_{\nu} h_{\mu \sigma}
		+ \partial_{\sigma} \partial_{\mu} h_{\nu \rho}
		- \partial_{\sigma} \partial_{\nu} h_{\mu \rho}
		- \partial_{\rho} \partial_{\mu} h_{\nu \sigma}
		+ \order{h^2}
	\right).
\end{equation}
Thus we can write the linearized Ricci tensor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-ricci-tensor-lin}
	R_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \left(
		\partial_{\alpha} \partial_{\mu} h_{\nu}^{\alpha}
		+ \partial_{\alpha} \partial_{\nu} h_{\mu}^{\alpha}
		- \partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} h
		- \Box h_{\mu\nu}
		+ \order{h^2}
	\right)
\end{equation}
and Ricci scalar
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-ricci-scalar-lin}
	R = \eta_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}h - \Box h_{\mu\nu} + \order{h^2}
\end{equation}
where $h = \eta^{\mu\nu}h_{\mu\nu}$ is the trace of of the metric perturbation and $\Box$ is the Minkowski-spacetime D'Alembertian operator:
\begin{equation}
	\Box \vcentcolon= \eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} = -\frac{1}{c^2} \partial_t^2 + \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 + \partial_z^2.
\end{equation}
This yields the linearized Einstein tensor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-einstein-lin}
	G_{\mu\nu} =
		\frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_{\mu}\partial_{\sigma}\Bar{h}_{\nu}^{\rho}
		+ \partial_{\nu}\partial_{\sigma}\Bar{h}_{\mu}^{\rho}
		- \Box \Bar{h}_{\sigma \rho}
		- \eta_{\mu\nu}\partial_{\sigma}\partial_{\rho}\Bar{h}^{\sigma\rho} \right)
		+ \order{h^2}
\end{equation}
where $\Bar{h}_{\mu\nu} := h_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\eta_{\mu\nu}h$ is the trace-reversed metric perturbation (called so because its trace is $\Bar{h} = -h$).

We can simplify these terms further by choosing the appropriate gauge.
To do so we must first investigate how $g_{\mu\nu}$ behaves under a gauge transformation.
Suppose we make a small transformation to the coordinate system
\begin{equation}
	x^{\alpha} \rightarrow x'^{\alpha} = x^{\alpha} + \xi^{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
The metric transforms as
\begin{align}
	g_{\alpha\beta} \rightarrow g'_{\alpha\beta}
		&= \frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x'^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial x'^{\beta}} g_{\mu\nu}(x) \\
		&= g_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_{\alpha} \xi_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} \xi_{\alpha} + \order{(\partial \xi)^2}.
\end{align}
or in terms of the metric perturbation,
\begin{equation}
	g'_{\alpha\beta} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} + h_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_{\alpha} \xi_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} \xi_{\alpha} + \order{h (\partial \xi), (\partial \xi)^2}.
\end{equation}
We can write this as $g'_{\alpha\beta} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} + h'_{\alpha\beta} + \order{h (\partial \xi), (\partial \xi)^2}$,
from which we see how the perturbation has transformed:
\begin{equation}
	h'_{\alpha\beta} = h_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_{\alpha} \xi_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} \xi_{\alpha}
\end{equation}
Trace-reversing again, we get
\begin{equation}
	\Bar{h}'_{\alpha\beta} = \Bar{h}_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_{\alpha} \xi_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} \xi_{\alpha} + \eta_{\alpha\beta} \eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu} \xi_{\nu}.
\end{equation}

Analogous to the Lorenz gauge choice in electromagnetism, we assert the condition $\partial_{\alpha} \Bar{h}^{\alpha\beta} = 0$ in this gauge and find $\xi$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}
	\Box \xi_{\beta} = \partial_{\mu} \Bar{h}^{\mu}_{\beta}.
\end{equation}
Indeed solutions to this exists, therefore we are safe to make the gauge transformation.
The Lorenz gauge condition is chosen because it results in the divergence terms (all but the $\Box$ term) of \cref{eq:gr-einstein-lin} vanish.
In doing so, we reduce the linearized Einstein field equations to simply
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-linear}
	-\Box \Bar{h}_{\mu\nu} + \order{h^2} = \frac{16\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}

In the Newtonian (slowly-varying) limit, the D'Alembertian operator becomes a spatial Laplace operator, and it can be shown that the trace-reversed perturbation reduces to the Newtonian gravitational potential $\Phi$ and the energy-momentum tensor reduces to just the mass density, recovering the Poisson equation for Newtonian gravity: $\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi G\rho$.


\subsection{Gravitational waves}

In vacuum, the energy-momentum tensor is zero so the field equation is simply $\Box\Bar{h}_{\mu\nu}=0$, the solution to which is a monochromatic plane wave propagating at the speed of light:
\begin{equation}
	\Bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = A_{\mu\nu}\cos\left(k_\sigma x^\sigma - \phi_{\mu\nu}\right)
\end{equation}
where $A_{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi_{\mu\nu}$ are the amplitude and phase of the wave.
The 4-vector $k^{\mu}$ contains the frequency $k^0 = -\omega = -2\pi f$ and the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ pointing in the direction of propagation.
The Lorenz gauge condition can now be expressed as $0 = \partial_{\mu} \Bar{h}^{\mu\nu} = -k_{\mu} A^{\mu\nu} \sin (k_{\alpha} x^{\alpha})$, which is satisfied if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-transverse}
	k_{\mu} A^{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
This means that the plane wave only has components orthogonal to $k_{\mu}$, i.e. it is transverse wave.
Furthermore, \cref{eq:gr-transverse} sets four conditions on what was originally ten components, so our choice of the Lorenz gauge has reduced the number independent components in the solution to six.

In the slowly-varying case the gauge condition can be further restricted by making the metric perturbation purely spatial, ($h_{00}=h_{0i}=0$) and traceless ($h=h_i^i$=0).
In this \textit{transverse-traceless (TT) gauge}, we write the metric perturbation as $h_{\mu\nu}^{TT}$ (no overline necessary because in this gauge $\Bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu}$).
These gauge conditions again reduce the number of components by four, so now the solution has only two independent components.
For a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the $z$ direction, these two components are
\begin{align}
	h_{11}^{TT} &= -h_{22}^{TT} = h_+(t) \\
	h_{12}^{TT} &= h_{21}^{TT} = h_{\times}(t)
\end{align}
and are called the plus and cross polarizations, respectively.
The effect of these polarizations on an array of test particles is a stretching and compressing of the distances between the particles in the $xy$ plane.
This gives us a means of observing a gravitational wave:
measuring the distances between two ``test masses'' along one axis and between two separate test masses along another axis perpendicular to first.

To determine the energy emitted by gravitational waves, we must consider a source, i.e. a non-zero energy-momentum tensor.
This requires a general solution to \cref{eq:gr-linear}.
To do so we define an \textit{effective energy-momentum tensor} $\tau^{\mu\nu}$ that incorporates the $\order{h^2}$ terms such that the field equations become
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-effective}
	\Box \Bar{h}^{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \tau^{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
The solution to which is
\begin{equation}
	\Bar{h}^{\mu\nu}(t, \mathbf{x}) = \frac{4G}{c^4} \int \frac{\tau^{\mu\nu}(t - \norm{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x'}}/c, x')}{\norm{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x'}}} d^3 x'.
\end{equation}
At some fixed distance $r$ far from the zone (much greater than the GW wavelength), $\norm{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x'}} \simeq r$, so we get
\begin{equation}
	\Bar{h}^{\mu\nu}(t, \mathbf{x}) \simeq \frac{4G}{c^4 r} \int \tau^{\mu\nu}(t - r/c, x') d^3 x'.
\end{equation}
Imposing the Lorenz gauge conditions on \cref{eq:gr-effective} results in a set of conservation laws $\partial_{\mu} \tau^{\mu\nu} = 0$.
These can give us an explicit expression for the spatial components of $\tau^{\mu\nu}$ in terms of its temporal component $t^{00}$, resulting in the following integral for the spatial components of $\Bar{h}^{\mu\nu}$:
\begin{align}
	\Bar{h}^{ij}(t, \mathbf{x}) &\simeq \frac{2G}{c^4 r} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \int x'^{i} x'^{j} \tau^{00}(t - r/c, x') d^3 x'\\
	&\simeq \frac{2G}{c^4 r} \ddot{I}^{ij}(t-r/c)
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
	I^{ij}(t) \equiv \int x'^{i} x'^{j} \tau^{00}(t - r/c, x') d^3 x'
\end{equation}
is the quadrupole tensor.
The conservation laws have implicitly removed terms corresponding to the time evolution of total linear and angular momentum, in contrast to electromagnetic theory where the equivalent electric and magnetic dipole terms do not vanish.

Finally, we can once again project to the TT gauge using the projection operator $P_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - n_i n_j$, where $n^i \equiv x^i / r$ is the wave propagation unit vector, to get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-h(t)}
	\Bar{h}^{TT}_{ij}(t, \mathbf{x}) \simeq \frac{2G}{c^4 r} \ddot{I}^{TT}_{ij}(t-r/c)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gr-quadrupole}
	I^{TT}_{ij}(t) = P_{ik} I^{kl} P_{lj} - \frac{1}{2} P_{ij} P_{kl} I^{kl}.
\end{equation}


\section{Sources of gravitational waves}\label{sec:gw-sources}

\Crefrange{eq:gr-h(t)}{eq:gr-quadrupole} show that any system whose quadrupole moment has a non-vanishing second derivative can generate \acp{GW}, which requires some non-spherically symmetric motion of masses.
We can make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the GW amplitude by thinking of the quadrupole tensor in terms of the velocity of the non-spherically symmetric motion of the source: $\ddot{I} \sim d^2/dt^2 (M R^2) \sim M v_{\textrm{NS}}^2$.
Then the GW amplitude is
\begin{equation}
	h_0 \sim \frac{GM v_{\textrm{NS}}^2}{c^4 r}.
\end{equation}
For a terrestial, human-scale source this is incredibly small: given an object of mass $M=1$\,kg rotating with a tangential velocity of $v_{\textrm{NS}}^2=1\,mathrm{m/s^2}$, observed at a distance $r \gg c/v_{\textrm{NS}}^2$, the amplitude is $h \ll 10^{-53}$.
Clearly high masses and rotational speeds are needed to produce observable GWs.

Thus far, 90 gravitational wave signals originating from \acp{CBC} have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo detector network~\citep{gwtc3}. These include two \ac{BNS} (GW170817 and GW190425) and two \ac{NSBH} (GW200105 and GW200115) mergers. The rest are associated with \ac{BBH} mergers. There has yet to be a detection of a \ac{GW} signal with a significant probability of having a non-\ac{CBC} origin.


\subsection{Compact binary mergers}

Consider a binary system of massive, compact objects $m_1$ and $m_2$ (with total mass $M = m_1 + m_2$), orbiting about their common center of mass.
These could be neutron stars, black holes, or white dwarf stars.
For most of its lifetime, the binary generates continuous \acp{GW} at a frequency twice the orbital frequency $\omega$:
\begin{align}
	h_+ &= -\frac{4 G \mu}{c^2 r} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 \cos (2 \omega t) \\
	h_{\times} &= -\frac{4 G \mu}{c^2 r} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 \sin (2 \omega t)
\end{align}
where $\mu = m_1 m_2 / M$ is the reduced mass.
Over time, the orbit decays due to the loss of energy to \ac{GW} emission, causing the frequency and amplitude of the emission to increase as the objects spiral in towards each other.
It turns out that this time-evolution scales quite dramatically:
\begin{equation}
	\dot{f} = \frac{96}{5}\pi^{8/3} \frac{\mu}{M} \left(\frac{G M}{c^3}\right)^{5/3} f^{11/3}.
\end{equation}
The coalescence of the two objects therefore creates a distinct \ac{GW} signature, characterized by a relatively short-duration ($\lesssim$1\,s for \acp{BBH}, tens to hundreds of seconds for \acp{NSBH} and \acp{BNS}), high frequency ($\sim$10-1000\,Hz) chirp.
It is useful to think of the characteristic GW amplitude in terms of the chirp mass $\mathcal{M} \equiv \mu^{3/5} M^{2/5}$:
\begin{equation}
	h_0 = 2.6 \times 10^{-23} \left( \frac{\mathcal{M}}{\msol} \right)^{5/3} \left( \frac{f_{\mathrm{GW}}}{100\,\mathrm{Hz}} \right)^{2/3} \left( \frac{R}{100\,\mathrm{Mpc}} \right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
As we shall see later this makes the detection of \acp{CBC} feasible for systems of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes around 100\,Hz.
These violent merger events also happen very frequently, making them the prime candidate for detecting gravitational waves with current GW detectors~\cite{aLIGO_prospects}.


\subsection{Continuous wave sources}

Continuous \acp{GW} generated from binary systems may range from very low frequency (nanoHertz-range) waves from supermassive \ac{BH} binaries, to milliHertz waves from stellar-mass galactic binaries, but in higher frequency bands the best candidate sources for continuous waves are isolated, rapidly rotating \acp{NS}~\citep{Riles_2017}.
If such \iac{NS} is non-axisymmetric, it generates \acp{GW} with a characteristic amplitude dependent on the $z$-axis moment of inertia, the ellipticity of the star $\varepsilon$,  and its rotational frequency $f_0$:
\begin{equation}
	h_0 = 4.2 \times 10^{-25} \frac{\varepsilon}{10^{-5}} \frac{I^{33}}{10^{45 g cm^2}} \left( \frac{f_0}{100\,\mathrm{Hz}} \right)^2 \left( \frac{R}{10\,\mathrm{kpc}} \right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
These emissions would have to be much closer to be observable, but unlike \acp{CBC}, isolated \acp{NS} are much more abundant within our galaxy.
Low-mass X-ray binaries, consisting of a neutron star accreting matter from a stellar companion, are another potential source of continuous \acp{GW}.
Since these sources are known through electromagnetic observations, they allow for targeted searches that account for the known sky locations.


\subsection{Burst sources}

GW bursts are short-duration events not generated by binary mergers; their time evolution is too difficult to model due to their unpredictable or poorly understood dynamical behavior.
\acp{CCSN} are the most promising burst source to be detected, although their \ac{GW} emission is still expected to be too weak for detecting events outside the galactic neighborhood, and the rate of galactic \acp{CCSN} is expected to be only one to a few per century~\citep{Adams_2013, Maoz_2010}.
Nonetheless there is evidence from electromagnetic observations that many CCSN exhibit the necessary asymmetries for GW emission.

There are many proposed scenarios for how such asymmetries could manifest, many supported by simulations~\citep{Fryer_2011, Fryer_2002}.
These simulations also face many hurdles that limit their accuracy: they have to capture the effects of general relativity, neutrino transport, and magnetic field interactions.
Different models also focus on different phases of the collapse, and account for different supernova remnants (either a neutron star or a black hole).
In summary, models have been formulated predicting GW emission from asymmetries in the core bounce phase due to rotation or an asymmetric core; from convection processes, or bar-mode instabilities in the proto-neutron star (if one forms); from fragmentation of the core itself, or within a massive accreting disk if the remnant becomes a black hole; and from Rossby wave (r-mode) instabilities in a cooling proto-neutron star.
The result is a wide range of predictions for the amplitude, frequency evolution, and duration of the gravitational waves produced by CCSN.



Other potential burst sources include magnetar flares and cosmic string cusps.


\subsection{Stochastic background}

The superposition of all \acp{GW} forms a stochastic \ac{GW} background analogous to the \ac{CMB}~\citep{Christensen_2018}.
This background is comprised of stellar-mass binary \ac{BH} and \ac{NS} mergers at frequencies currently observable by \ac{GW} detectors, but at lower frequencies galactic white dwarf binaries and supermassive BH mergers would also contribute to the stochastic background.
At cosmological distances, relic gravitational waves from the very early universe could be detectable via their effect on the polarization of the \ac{CMB} radiation.


\section{Multi-messenger astronomy}

In addition to being the first ever detection of a merger between two neutron stars, GW170817 ushered forth a new era of astronomy, making history as the first astronomical event observed by both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves.
The combined localization of the LIGO-Virgo network and Fermi-GBM prompted a world-wide follow-up campaign from observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum.
This led to identification of an optical counterpart near NGC 4993, which in turn allowed astronomers to make the first confirmed observation of a kilonova, the multi-band emission of electromagnetic waves resulting from the radioactive decay of r-process material formed and ejected in all directions by the merger.

{\color{red}Introduce what can be learned and talk about targeted burst searches.}


\section{Gravitational wave detectors}\label{sec:gw-detectors}

Detection of gravitational waves requires measuring the transverse stretching and compressing of space. The earliest attempt at this was done through resonant mass detectors, solid, vibrationally isolated cylinders tuned to a particular frequency that could be used to detect the effect of gravitational waves on the length of the cylinders. These proved incapable of reaching the required sensitivity for detecting even the strongest gravitational waves in the frequency band they were designed for ($\sim1$ kHz).

The current era of \ac{GW} detection is dominated by laser interferometers inspired by the simple Michelson interferometer. There are currently three observatories in operation: \ac{LIGO}, consisting of \ac{LHO} in Washington and \ac{LLO} in Louisiana, and the Virgo observatory in Italy. Additional detectors in Japan (Kagra) and India (\ac{LIGO} India) are under construction, and projects for next-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and \ac{LISA}) are on the horizon.

A \ac{GW} interferometer is configured so that the anti-symmetric output port (the output not leading back to the laser source) observes no signal due to destructive interference. If one interferometer arm is elongated relative to the other, the phase shift between the signals from both arms results in some constructive interference; thus the amplitude of a gravitational wave passing through the plane of the detector arms is converted to an amplitude in laser light measured at the output port. Sensitivity scales with interferometer arm length, but the incredible length required to detect gravitational waves from even the loudest sources (100s of km in order to observe black hole binary mergers) makes this infeasible. However, the effective arm length can be increased by making the arms Fabry-Perot cavities, so that light travels many ($\sim300$) times back and forth in each arm before leaving through the beam splitter.

{\color{red}Probably talk about a bunch of instrument noise sources here, e.g. shot noise and thermal noise.}

Other methods that have been implemented to dramatically improve the sensitivity current-generation of \ac{aLIGO} and Advanced Virgo include increasing laser power or injecting squeezed light to reduce the effects of photon shot noise; implementing a power recycling cavity at the symmetric output that sends the constructively-interfering light leaving in that direction back into the interferometer; implementing a signal recycling cavity at the anti-symmetric output to tune the most sensitive frequency band of the detector; larger mirrors to combat radiation pressure on the mirrors due to high laser power~\citep{Creighton_2011}.

The two \ac{LIGO} detectors began \ac{O1} on September 12, 2015, and made the first detection of a \ac{GW} from a \ac{BBH} merger on September 14, 2015~\citep{gw150914}.
This was followed by two more \ac{BBH} detections before the end of the run on January 16, 2016~\citep{gwtc1}.
\Ac{O2} began on November 30, 2016 after a period of detector upgrades and ended on August 25, 2017.
During that run, in addition to several more \ac{BBH} detections, the \ac{LIGO} network (with the addition of Virgo towards the end of the run) observed the first \ac{BNS} merger on August 17, 2017~\citep{gw170817}.
\Ac{O3}, which spanned April 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, came after another round of major improvements in the performance of the detectors~\citep{Buikema_2020} and the full inclusion of the Virgo detector in the \ac{GW} network.
Throughout \ac{O3}, \ac{LIGO} and Virgo observed a total of 74 \ac{GW} events~\citep{gwtc2,gwtc3}.
