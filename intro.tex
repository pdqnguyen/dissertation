\section{Introduction}

The two \ac{LIGO} detectors---\ac{LHO} and \ac{LLO}---began their first observing run (O1) on September 12, 2015, and made the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole (BBH) merger on September 14, 2015~\cite{gw150914}, followed by two more BBH detections before the end of the run on January 16, 2016~\cite{gwtc1}.
The second observing run (O2) began on November 30, 2016 after a period of detector upgrades and ended on August 25, 2017.
During O2, in addition to several more BBH detections, the \ac{LIGO} network observed the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger on August 17, 2017~\cite{gw170817}.
The third observing run (O3), which spanned April 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, came after another round of major improvements in the performance of the detectors~\cite{Buikema_2020} and the full inclusion of the Virgo detector in the GW network.
In the first half of the run, ending on October 1, 2020, \ac{LIGO} and Virgo observed a total of 39 GW events~\cite{gwtc2}.
